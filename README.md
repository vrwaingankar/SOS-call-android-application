# SOS-call-android-application
With the Covid19 second wave hitting severely on India, there was a need for Ambulance and oxygen supplies all over the country.
With lack of proper digital connectivity between public and hospitals, it was difficult for people to get medical help on time.
Keeping this in mind, I developed an android app which consists of phone numbers of nearest ambulance and oxygen supplier.
Public can use this app and with one click can book an ambulance over phone call and send his/ser current location.
The application was built for Uttar Kannada disrict of Karnataka state.

Tools Used:
The application was built using MIT App Inventor

Usage:
By clicking on "Call Ambulance" or "Call Oxygen", a phone call will be connected to the service provider.
By clicking on "Send Location" the user's current location in latitude and longitude will be sent to the service provider.
Here the service provider is Ambulance or oxygen provider.

NOTE: The application was not published on App store. It was circulated through WhatsApp.
